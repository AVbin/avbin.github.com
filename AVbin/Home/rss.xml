    <description>AVbin is a thin cross-platform wrapper around Libav’s video and audio decoding functionality, providing binary compatibility for applications and languages that need it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AVbin was originally created for the Pyglet project as its media decoding/decompression library,  though others may find AVbin useful as well.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://avbin.github.com/AVbin/Home/Entries/2012/7/5_AVbin_9_Released_%28Unstable%29_files/AA043081_3x4a-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://avbin.github.com/AVbin/Home/Media/object010_1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left; padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:10px; width:183px; height:137px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I announce AVbin 9 today with mixed feelings.  It marks a lot of good work in build scripts and switching to Libav.  On the other hand, since I wanted to minimize C code changes for this release, the branch of Libav (0.6) that we used ends up being _older_ code than we used in the 8.1 release -- with some regressions in quality/performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End users are encouraged to use the 8.1 release for now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developers are encouraged to test version 9 out and give us feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;API Changes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	-	DEPRECATED avbin_get_ffmpeg_revision()&lt;br/&gt;	-	ADDED avbin_get_libav_commit()&lt;br/&gt;	-	ADDED avbin_get_libav_version()</description>

This was primarily a build-process fix release.  The most notable changes are that the 32-bit OS X and 64-bit Linux versions should actually work.  Version 8 of the former was actually 64-bit, version 8 of the latter didn’t link correctly.</description>

It was a very productive day.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://avbin.github.com/AVbin/Home/Entries/2011/12/10_AVbin_8_files/index1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://avbin.github.com/AVbin/Home/Media/object008_1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left; padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:10px; width:183px; height:137px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I am proud to announce AVbin 8, the first full release since 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To all those who pointed me in the right direction on mailing lists and forums:  Thank you!!!  I would like to specifically mention Alex Holkner, who created this project in the first place, and Micah Richert, whose shoulders I stood on for this release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AVbin 8 Highlights&lt;br/&gt;	-	Established which platforms were going to be supported going forward (added Win64 and OS X 64-bit Intel; dropped OS X 32-bit PPC)&lt;br/&gt;	-	Created development/build environments for each platform&lt;br/&gt;	-	Successfully compiled/released a build for each platform&lt;br/&gt;	-	Migrated from svn on Google Project to git on Github&lt;br/&gt;	-	Created a new project web site&lt;br/&gt;	-	28 commits&lt;br/&gt;	-	Approximately 15 issues closed...though mostly since they just don’t apply any more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Known Issues with AVbin 8:&lt;br/&gt;	-	The version of FFmpeg used is one year old, and has known bugs and security problems&lt;br/&gt;	-	The AVbin binaries have not been tested internally.&lt;br/&gt;	-	The AVbin binaries have not been tested with Pyglet.&lt;br/&gt;	-	It is known that the build doesn’t actually work for a lot of file formats you would expect it to on at least one platform (win32)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous release was based on a 3-year old FFmpeg revision.  That revision had even more bugs and security problems than the newer one we used.  When I took over as the new maintainer almost exactly a month ago, I accepted the generous offer of Micah Richert to use his personal build he had put together a year ago as a starting point.  Since using the newest code was not a goal for this release, I simply used the exact revision that Micah used, to minimize the already considerable effort it was taking to get this project resurrected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I’ve put together a &lt;a href=&quot;../Roadmap.html&quot;&gt;Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; for things to accomplish for AVbin 9.  Check it out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;~ Nathan</description>

AVbin has moved from subversion on Google code to Git on Github.  We hope that the move promotes more collaboration and participation in the project.</description>
